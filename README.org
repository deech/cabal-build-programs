* cabal-build-programs
  A Cabal library that allows build time dependencies on non-Haskell
  executables. As of this writing there is no convenient Cabal field for
  non-Haskell programs that are sometimes useful in a polyglot build like
  'cmake' or 'gprof'. This library solves that by providing a custom Cabal field
  "x-build-programs" which contains a list of such dependencies.

  See the [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-build-programs/docs/Distribution-Simple-BuildPrograms.html][Haddock documentation]] for much more detail.
